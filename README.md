# Snapshots of the spatial spin configuration in the broad-ferromagnetic phase

In this repository we provide a short film composed of snapshots of the spatial spin configuration during a transition between ordered states in the broad-ferromagnetic phase. The film complements the results presented in the paper *Stochastic field effects in a two-state system: symmetry breaking and symmetry restoring*.

The snapshots correspond to a system of size $L = 100$, field intensity $D = 0.1$, and temperature $T = 1.9$, which lies within the broad-ferromagnetic phase. In the simulation, we initialize the system at the completely ordered state of the magnetization $m(t=0) = -1$, and let it evolve. The film displays snapshots of the spatial spin configuration from $t = 21000$ MCS to $t = 23000$ MCS, during which the system jumps from $m \simeq -1$ to $m \simeq 1$. Snapshots are shown every 2 MCS. 

As can be seen in the film, the transition between ordered magnetization states occurs through the nucleation of droplets of the new phase.
